Directory Structure
-------------------
---Do not store any asset files in the root directory.---
Use subdirectories whenever possible.

---Do not create any additional directories in the root directory---
unless you really need to.

---Be consistent with naming---
If you decide to use camel case for directory names and low letters for assets, stick to that convention.

---Don’t try to move context-specific assets to the general directories.---
For instance, if there are materials generated from the model, don’t move them to Materials directory because later you won’t know where these come from.

---Use 3rd-Party to store assets imported from the Asset Store.---
They usually have their own structure that shouldn’t be altered.

---Use Sandbox directory for any experiments you’re not entirely sure about.---
While working on this kind of things, the last thing that you want to care about is a proper organization. Do what you want, then remove it or organize when you’re certain that you want to include it in your project. When you’re working on a project with other people, create your personal Sandbox subdirectory like: Sandbox/JohnyC.
